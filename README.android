## Steps for updating this crate

1.  In order to run cargo2android, for this crate, the BoringSSL rust bindings first needs to be
    built. Copy `googletest` to `boringssl`, which is needed to build the rust bindings

    ```
    $ cp -r external/googletest external/boringssl/src/third_party/
    ```
2.  Build the rust bindings (More information at
    https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/HEAD/BUILDING.md)

    ```
    $ cd external/boringssl/src
    $ cmake -DRUST_BINDINGS=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -B build
    $ make -C build
    ```
3.  Run `tools/external_updater/updater.sh update rust/crates/openssl`. Cargo errors causing the
    command to fail are expected (since the boringSSL crate is outside of the `openssl` directory,
    redshell is not able to access it).
4.  The repository should now be in a `tmp_auto_upgrade` branch, and the Android.bp will contain
    some error message.
5.  Run cargo_embargo

    ```
    $ cargo_embargo run cargo_embargo.json
    ```
6.  Clean up the changes in external/boringssl repository, and double check that the resulting
    Android.bp builds correctly by running `m libopenssl`.
7.  Commit the changes and upload the CL.
8.  `external/rust/crates/openssl-macros` should also be updated at the same time.
